abstract = {Bubbles are always encountered for gas–liquid two-phase flow in microchannels, and have potential applications in chemical engineering, polymer engineering, food engineering, and biological engineering. The bubble formation and breakup dynamics in microfluidic devices are reviewed in this article. The effects of the confinement of microchannels and the fluid flow on bubble formation and breakup dynamics are highlighted. The dynamical evolution of the gas–liquid interface during bubble formation and breakup in confined spaces is analyzed. The manipulation for the bubble formation and breakup in microfluidic devices is presented. The scaling laws for the bubble size in such devices are also reviewed. Finally, the key issues for the scaling-up of bubble generation in microfluidic devices are demonstrated.}

abstract  ="The serviceability of microfluidics-based instrumentation including ‘lab-on-a-chip’ systems critically depends on control of fluid motion. We are reporting here an alternative approach to microfluidics based upon the micromanipulation of discrete droplets of aqueous electrolyte by electrowetting. Using a simple open structure{,} consisting of two sets of opposing planar electrodes fabricated on glass substrates{,} positional and formational control of microdroplets ranging in size from several nanoliters to several microliters has been demonstrated at voltages between 15–100 V. Since there are no permanent channels or structures between the plates{,} the system is highly flexible and reconfigurable. Droplet transport is rapid and efficient with average velocities exceeding 10 cm s−1 having been observed. The dependence of the velocity on voltage is roughly independent of the droplet size within certain limits{,} thus the smallest droplets studied (∼3 nl) could be transported over 1000 times their length per second. Formation{,} mixing{,} and splitting of microdroplets was also demonstrated using the same microactuator structures. Thus{,} electrowetting provides a means to achieve high levels of functional integration and flexibility for microfluidic systems."}

abstract = {Microfluidic devices are emerging as an attractive technology for automatically orchestrating the reactions needed in a biological computer. Thousands of microfluidic primitives have already been integrated on a single chip, and recent trends indicate that the hardware complexity is increasing at rates comparable to Moore's Law. As in the case of silicon, it will be critical to develop abstraction layers--such as programming languages and Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs)--that decouple software development from changes in the underlying device technology. Towards this end, this paper presents BioStream, a portable language for describing biology protocols, and the Fluidic ISA, a stable interface for microfluidic chip designers. A novel algorithm translates microfluidic mixing operations from the BioStream layer to the Fluidic ISA. To demonstrate the benefits of these abstraction layers, we build two microfluidic chips that can both execute BioStream code despite significant differences at the device level. We consider this to be an important step towards building scalable biological computers.},

abstract = {Sample preparation is an indispensable process to biochemical reactions. Original reactants are usually diluted to the solutions with desirable concentrations. Since the reactants, like infant's blood, DNA evidence collected from a crime scene, or costly reagents, are extremely valuable, the usage of reactant must be minimized in the sample preparation process. In this paper, we propose the first reactant minimization approach, REMIA, during sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs). Given a target concentration, REMIA constructs a skewed mixing tree to guide the sample preparation process for reactant minimization. Experimental results demonstrate that REMIA can save about 31%~52% of reactant usage on average compared with three existing sample preparation methods. Besides, REMIA can be extended to tackle the sample preparation problem with multiple target concentrations, and the extended version also successfully decreases the reactant usage further.},

	abstract = { Microfluidic devices for manipulating fluids are widespread and finding uses in many scientific and industrial contexts. Their design often requires unusual geometries and the interplay of multiple physical effects such as pressure gradients, electrokinetics, and capillarity. These circumstances lead to interesting variants of well-studied fluid dynamical problems and some new fluid responses. We provide an overview of flows in microdevices with focus on electrokinetics, mixing and dispersion, and multiphase flows. We highlight topics important for the description of the fluid dynamics: driving forces, geometry, and the chemical characteristics of surfaces. },
